Bay Psalm Book,,1640,2013,14200000,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Bay_Psalm_Book_LoC.png,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Psalm_Book,"The Bay Psalm Book was the first book printed in British North America. The book is a metrical Psalter first printed in 1640 in Cambridge Massachusetts. The Psalms in it are metrical translations into English. The translations are not particularly polished and not one has remained in use although some of the tunes to which they were sung have survived (for instance ""Old 100th""). However  its production just 20 years after the Pilgrims' arrival at Plymouth Massachusetts represents a considerable achievement. It went through several editions and remained in use for well over a century. One of eleven known surviving copies of the first edition sold at auction in November 2013 for $14.2 million a record for a printed book."
